###

* I started this React Native Employee Manager app by following the instructions from the React Native Udemy course (Stephen Grider instructor)

* Next, I added some of my own code with the Nachos-UI styling library and various coding enhancements to iron out some issues.

* Next, I plan to add some more features, feel free to make any contributions

### Potential New Features

* Employee Status/Schedule (clocked in?)
* Employee task list (ie. tickets) - predefined and new
* What task are they doing currently, what has been done?
* Employee Requests
